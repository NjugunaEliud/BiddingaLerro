                    6.5. In the likely event that there is no unique bid, i.e. all bids ranging from the lowest Ush 500 up to the highest bid have two or more bids placed, the successful bid shall be the first in time to place the bid that is the lowest with the least number of bids placed on it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    6.6. Auction close: An action can have multiple winning bids within a fixed time auction. There fore, an Auction at a specific time may choose the lowest unique bid at the chosen time e.g. every 30mins the auction closes when the time allocated to the auction shall have expired. In these fixed time Auctions, the auction is initially created by Us with a defined amount of time, e.g. 24 hours, one week, etc. The type of auction is clearly displayed on the TV Screen and in the media and advertising for the auction.
